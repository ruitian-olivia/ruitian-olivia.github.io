Like many people, I’ve been spending more time outdoors during this pandemic.
While this means daily walks in my neighborhood, it also means getting out into
the wilderness and sleeping in a tent when I can. Although outdoor recreation
is one of the safer ways to entertain yourself these days, it’s not without its
own [concerns](https://www.recreateresponsibly.org/home). The difficulty of
safely getting to trailheads means that while I’m backpacking more than usual,
it’s still not as often as I’d like.

<!--more-->

That means I’m spending a decent chunk of time thinking about and planning
future trips. At some point in the process of doing this, I realized that I
could use the GIS skills from my day job to help make planning future trips more
efficient. In this post I walk through how you can use GIS tools in R to help
with some of the route planning for a multiday backpacking trip. Specifically,
how you can use open source spatial data on geography and transportation
infrastructure to identify potential campsites along a hiking trail.

This was largely an exercise in seeing how I could apply GIS skills I’ve learned
in the study of political violence to small-scale GPS navigation. I haven’t had
the opportunity to hit the trail and test out any of the assumptions I use in
this process yet, so you should view this post as more of a (loose) method than
concrete suggestions. For a short and simple point-to-point hike with only one
route, there’s really no need to engage in this level of GIS analysis. I’ve kept
things simple to make them easier to follow, but this approach could actually be
useful and save some time when planning a longer trip with many potential
routes.

# Backcountry camping

At some point in the future, I want to hike the
[Uwharrie Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwharrie_Trail) in
[Uwharrie National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwharrie_National_Forest)
in central North Carolina, near where I went to grad school. As I think about
this (probably far off) trip, I’ve been using CalTopo to plan my route.

If you spend any amount of time in the outdoors, you should know about
[CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/). CalTopo is a website that lets you plan routes
(hiking, skiing, rafting, etc.) on top of super high resolution topographic
maps. You can then turn your smartphone into a full-featured GPS and use it to
follow those routes (CalTopo offes a mobile app, as does
[Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/), both for about $20 a year). While the
Uwharrie Trail is a pretty straightforward hike, I’ve been using this as an
excuse to try and apply my GIS skills in a new context.

CalTopo is great, but it’s very point and click. I like doing things
programmatically when I can, so that means it’s time to grab some of the open
source data that CalTopo uses so we can play around with it in R. The base map
in CalTopo is called MapBuilder Topo, and uses
[OpenStreetMap data](https://help.caltopo.com/discussions/maps/2464-mapbuilder-raw-data)
as its starting point, so let’s start there.

## Disclaimer

This guide is intended to show how to identify *potential* backcountry campsites
on public land where dispersed camping is permitted. If you are backpacking in
an area with designated, maintained backcountry campsites, you should use them.
Dispersed camping is typically permitted in less-traveled areas where the impact
of campers is better minimized by diffusing it rather than concentrating it into
a handful of designated sites.[^dispersed]

[^dispersed]: See [here](https://sectionhiker.com/what-is-the-difference-between-frontcountry-camping-backcountry-or-designated-campsites-and-dispersed-camping/) for a discussion of different types of campsites and contexts in which they are usually found.

Always check regulations for any land you plan to camp on to see if there are
specific requirements for site selection or areas where camping is prohibited.
Picking an *actual* campsite requires identifying areas where your saftey will
be maximized and the longterm impact of your stay will be minimized. See
[this guide](https://wilderness.net/learn-about-wilderness/benefits/outdoor-recreation/camping/where-to-camp.php)
for the basics and
[this series](https://andrewskurka.com/tag/five-star-campsite-selection/)
for a slightly more hardcore set of principles to follow. And remember, never go
into the wilderness without telling someone where you’re going and when you
should be back.

# Getting the data

[OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) (OSM) is an open source
map of the entire globe; think of it as a hybrid of Google Maps and Wikipedia.
OSM is designed so that anyone can easily add to or edit it. Setting aside the
normative value of this perspective, this is helpful for us because it means
that OSM is transparent. We can use the excellent `osmdata`
[R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/) to query OSM via the
\[Overpass API\], and we can use OSM itself via the
[OSM website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to learn the various parameters
we’ll use to query OSM.

## Trails

The
[getting started vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/articles/osmdata.html)
covers much of the basics of using `osmdata`. The key functions are
`osmdata::opq()`, which builds a query to the Overpass API, and
`osmdata::add_osm_feature()`, which requests specific features. OSM classifies
features using
[key-value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database),
and we can use the OSM website to figure out just which pairs we need. Navigate
to an area of interest, right-click on the feature of interest, and then select
“query features.”

![](/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/ut_query.png)

Next, select the desired feature in the dialog on the left of the screen. In
this case, select the “Relation” rather than the “Path” because the path will
only include one segment of the trail while the relation will include its entire
length.

![](/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/ut_select.png)

We can see here that the Uwharrie Trail relation has `type=hiking`, so that’s
the key-value pair wew’ll have to specify in our query.

![](/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/ut_rel.png)

Make sure to use the `bbox` argument to `osmdata::opq()`, otherwise you’ll
request every hiking trail in the world\! You can manually specify the four
edges of a bounding box to search in, or you can use the `osmdata::getbb()`
function to get it automatically using the
[Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) geocoder.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(osmdata)

## get hiking routes in Uwharrie National Forest
unf_trails <- opq(bbox = getbb('uwharrie national forest usa')) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = 'route', value = 'hiking') %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

Notice that we use the `osmdata::osmdata_sf()` function to convert the resulting
object for use with the `sf` R package. Let’s inspect the resulting object of
class `osmdata_sf`.

``` r
## inspect
unf_trails
```

    ## Object of class 'osmdata' with:
    ##                  $bbox : 35.3951403,-80.0236608,35.4351403,-79.9836608
    ##         $overpass_call : The call submitted to the overpass API
    ##                  $meta : metadata including timestamp and version numbers
    ##            $osm_points : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 3341 points
    ##             $osm_lines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 26 linestrings
    ##          $osm_polygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 0 polygons
    ##        $osm_multilines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 1 multilinestrings
    ##     $osm_multipolygons : NULL

We can see that the `unf_trails` object includes points, lines, polygons,
multilines, and multipolygons. We want to use the lines since that will include
any short trail segments that aren’t part of a larger trail. We can easily plot
the trails using this object.

``` r
## plot
plot(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/plot_trails-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Don’t get lost

Let’s do some quick sanity checks. First, Wikipedia tells us the trail should be
about 20 miles. We can use the `sf::st_length()` function to measure the length
of each trail segment, and the `sf::st_union()` function to combine all
segments. We’ll get our answer in meters, which as a metric-deprived American,
won’t be all that helpful to me. To get around this, we can use the
\``units::st_units()` function to convert from meters to miles.

``` r
## measure total trail length
st_union(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry) %>% # combine all segments.
  st_length() %>% # measure length
  units::set_units(mi) # convert to miles
```

    ## 28.26457 [mi]

While that’s initially concerning, a closer reading of the Wikipedia article for
the trail reveals that it was originally 40 miles long, so OSM likely includes
some of the Northern section of the trail beyond what’s officially recognized
today.

We should also plot the bounding box that `osmdata::getbb()` ends up generating
to ensure we’re not missing any part of the trail. We can do this with the
`OpenStreetMap` \[R package\](<https://cran.r-project.org/package=OpenStreetMap>.
Here we unfortunately need to manually specify the bounding box as a series of
two vectors with the latitude and longitude coordinate of the upper-left and
lower-right of the box. `OpenStreetMap::openmap()` uses (latitude, longitude)
pairs, *not* (longitude, latitude) pairs as is more common in GIS, i.e.,
(y, x) not (x, y), so be sure to include them in that
order.`[^lat-long]`{markdown} `OpenStreetMap::openproj()` also requires a
`projection` argument, so I use `sf::st_crs(4326)$proj4string` to generate one
automatically, ensuring I don’t introduce a type somewhere by accident.

`[^lat-long]:`{markdown} I spent 20 minutes not understanding why I couldn’t get this to work before I finally read the documenation. Don’t be like me, folks.

``` r
library(OpenStreetMap)

## get bounding box
unf_bb <- getbb('uwharrie national forest usa')

## get OSM tiles
unf_tile <- openmap(c(unf_bb[2,1],  # lat
                      unf_bb[1,1]), # long
                    c(unf_bb[2,2],  # lat
                      unf_bb[1,2]), # long
                    type = 'osm', mergeTiles = T)

## project map tiles and plot (OSM comes in Mercator...)
plot(openproj(unf_tile), projection = st_crs(4326)$proj4string)

## plot trails
plot(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/osm_plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Uh oh. We can see that we’re only getting a small portion of the total trail and
that it trails (heh) off the map on three sides. That’s not great, so let’s fix
it. We can start by looking up Uwharrie National Forest itself on the OSM
website. This gives us the boundaries of the official forest land in orange.

![](/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/unf.png)

We can see from the dialog on the left that the forest’s OSM ID is 2918413, so
we can use the `osmdata::opq_osm_id()` function to get the polygons for the
forest’s boundaries. Let’s grab the forest boundaries and plot them, along with
the bounding box they imply and the bounding box that resulted from
`osmdata::getbb()` (in red) for comparison.

``` r
## get Uwharrie National Forest Boundaries
unf <- opq_osm_id(type = 'relation', id = 2918413) %>% 
  osmdata_sf()

## plot Uwharrie National Forest polygons
plot(unf$osm_multipolygons$geometry, col = 'lightgreen', border = NA, bty = 'n')

## construct line for original bounding box
plot(st_multilinestring(list(matrix(c(unf_bb[1, 1], unf_bb[2, 1],
                                      unf_bb[1, 1], unf_bb[2, 2],
                                      unf_bb[1, 2], unf_bb[2, 2],
                                      unf_bb[1, 2], unf_bb[2, 1],
                                      unf_bb[1, 1], unf_bb[2, 1]),
                                      ncol = 2, byrow = T))),
     add = T, col = 'red')

## plot bounding box for Uwharrie National Forest polygons
plot(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)), add = T)

## plot trails
plot(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/bbox_plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Wow, we were missing a lot before. Let’s use the bounding box for the entire
forest as our new bounding box. First, we plot OSM using this new bounding box.
`st_bbox()` yields a vector of four numbers, rather than the matrix that
`osmdata::getbb()` produces, so we need to work around this and specify the
top-left and bottom-right corners of our new, bigger bounding box.

``` r
## get OSM tile for Uwharrie National Forest polygons
unf_full_tile <- openmap(c(st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)[4],  # lat
                           st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)[1]), # long
                         c(st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)[2],  # lat
                           st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)[3]), # long
                         type = 'osm', mergeTiles = T)

## project and plot OSM tile
plot(openproj(unf_full_tile), projection = st_crs(4326)$proj4string)

## plot trails
plot(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/osm_plot_full-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That’s much better\! We’re getting a lot of area beyond the trail, but it’s easy
to filter that out later so it’s better to grab too much than too little.

### The whole trail

Now we can go back and grab all hiking trails in Uwharrie National Forest using
our new bounding box. `osmdata::opq()` expects a bounding box in a certain
format, so let’s inspect it to see what we’re working with and what we need to
reshape the output of `sf::st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons)` into:

``` r
## bbox format osmdata::opq() expects
unf_bb
```

    ##         min       max
    ## x -80.02366 -79.98366
    ## y  35.39514  35.43514

``` r
## rearrange sf::st_bbox() output
matrix(st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons), ncol = 2,
       dimnames = list(c('x', 'y'), c('min', 'max')))
```

    ##         min       max
    ## x -80.17085 -79.73170
    ## y  35.21987  35.63684

Note that I’m specifying row and column names when creating the new bounding
box. Without them, `osmdata::opq()` will fail\! We can now plug this new bounding
box object into `osmdata::opq()` and get all hiking routes in the forest.

``` r
## get hiking trails in all of Uwharrie National Forest
unf_trails_full <- opq(bbox = matrix(st_bbox(unf$osm_multipolygons), ncol = 2,
                                     dimnames = list(c('x', 'y'), c('min', 'max')))) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = 'route', value = 'hiking') %>% 
  osmdata_sf()

## plot
plot(unf_trails_full$osm_lines$geometry, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/opq_trails_full-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now we’re getting a bunch of trails across the Pee Dee River in Morrow Mountain
State Park. Again it’s easy to drop these extra trails later, so for the moment,
more complete is better than less complete. These data come from OpenStreetMap,
so they also include lots of usuable data. Let’s take a look at the fields
included in our lines:

``` r

We can use the “name” field to subset the data. If you were considering some
parallel or spur trails, you could use `sf::st_filter()` in combination with
\``sf::st_is_within_distance()` to instead just grab trails near your primary
trail.

``` r
## extract OSM lines and filter
ut <- unf_trails_full$osm_lines %>% filter(name == 'Uwharrie Trail')
```

Now we’ve gotten the Uwharrie Trail twice. Once using a smaller bounding box
and once using a larger one. We can plot them both and see if there were any
segments the intial query missed

``` r
## plot
plot(ut$geometry, col = 'red')
plot(unf_trails$osm_lines$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/ut_full_comparison-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Luckily the initial query still picked up every segment, but that won’t always
be the case if you start with an inaccurate initial bounding box. If the entire
Uwharrie Trail wasn’t collected into a relation, we might have missed large
chunks of it on either end. Now we can use the bounding box for the Uwharrie
Trail to capture any other features we care about nearby.

## Water

The first other feature we need is water. On any multi-day trip, being able to
refill your water is essential. The
[OSM wiki page on waterways](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:waterway#Values)
shows us that they values we need to grab relevant water sources are `river` and
`stream`. Although not well-documented, you can supply multiple `value`
arguments to `osmdata::opq()` using `c()`. This will let us quickly and easily
grab both rivers and streams in the area.[^opq-multiple]

[^opq-multiple]: If we didn’t do this, we’d have to use `c()` to combine multiple `osmdata_sf` objects and then extract the `osm_lines` object from the combined `osmdata_sf` object.

``` r
## create bbox for just the Uwharrie Trail; no need for all water in the whole National Forest
ut_bb <- matrix(st_bbox(ut), ncol = 2, dimnames = list(c('x', 'y'), c('min', 'max')))

## get rivers and streams and extract OSM lines
ut_water <- opq(bbox = ut_bb) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = 'waterway', value = c('river', 'stream')) %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
```

Our next step will be to drop any water sources more than a kilometer from the
trail. This will simplify our analysis later and also minimizes our
environmental impact. To conduct GIS operations in meters, we need to project
our data from latitude and longitude-based
[WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) to a meter-based
coordiante reference system (CRS). The CRS database epsg.io shows that
[NAD83/North Carolina(EPSG:32119)](http://epsg.io/32119) is the projection for
data in North Carolina, so we use `sf::st_transform()` along with `sf::st_crs()`
to project our trail and water source objects. This lets us calculate distances
in feet/meters rather than decimal degrees. We’ll use this to limit the water
features to those that fall within 1km of the trail. This way we’re not limiting
ourselves to only water features that directly intersect the trail, but we’re
also not retaining a bunch of features that are farther off-trail than I like to
hike for water.

``` r
## project trail
ut <- st_transform(ut, st_crs(32119))

## project water sources
ut_water <- ut_water$osm_lines %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(32119)) %>% 
  st_filter(ut, .predicate = st_is_within_distance, dist = 1000)

## plot
plot(ut_water$geometry, col = 'lightblue')
plot(ut$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/water_filter-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Roads

If we want to be near water, we want to be far from roads. OpenStreetMap has
lots of different categories of roads, so we’ll want to capture all the major
ones, as well as service roads and “tracks”, which is how OpenStreetMap
refers to forest roads.[^forest-roads] OSM identifies roads with
the key “highway,” and inspecting the
[OSM wiki page on roads](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) shows
us the various values we’ll need to grab all relevant roads.

[^forest-roads]: The US Forest Service maintains GIS data on forest roads on National Forest land, but the [API](https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/national-forest-system-roads-feature-layer) to access them is…less than user friendly so I’m ignoring them for this illustration.

``` r
## get roads, project, and limit to w/in 1000 m of trail
ut_roads <- opq(bbox = ut_bb) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = 'highway',
                  value = c('primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'residential',
                            'unclassified', 'track', 'service')) %>% 
  osmdata_sf() %>% 
  magrittr::extract2('osm_lines') %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(32119)) %>% 
  st_filter(ut, .predicate = st_is_within_distance, dist = 1000)

## plot
plot(ut_roads$geometry, col = 'black')
plot(ut$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

Note the use of `magrittr::extract2()` to extract the `osm_lines` object from
the `osmdata_sf` object returned by `osmdata::osmdata_sf()`. This is how you can
access a list element in a pipeline, and is equivalent to `$osm_lines`.

# Campsites

To locate potential campsites we need to identify our priorities and use them to
define a set of rules for selecting potential sites. For this exercise, I’m
using the following:

1.  I’d like to be within 750 feet of a water source. Some (more hardcore)
    backpackers prefer to be farther away from water sources to minimize the chance
    of encountering animals. Since Uwharrie National Forest isn’t an area with
    heightened bear activity, I’m willing to trade the chance of a raccoon sniffing
    around my bear canister for a shorter walk to refill my water.

2.  The US Forest Service requires that you camp at least [200 feet away from any water source](https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/know-before-you-go/responsible-recreation).
    This is
    [good practice everywhere](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/travel-camp-on-durable-surfaces/),
    but it’s required in National Forests, so we
    want to make sure any potential campsites are at least 200 feet from any water
    features.

3.  The Uwharrie Trail is a fairly heavily-trafficked trail, so I’d like to avoid
    going more than 1/4 mile off-trail to find a campsite. This will minimize the
    disturbance to the surrounding area.[^disturbance] All of the
    semi-official campsites on the Uwharrie Trail are a good ways off the trail
    itself, so staying near the trail will contain my impact on a large scale, but
    minimize it locally.

4.  If you’re not in a designated campsite, you should be at least
    [200 feet away from any trail](https://sectionhiker.com/campsite-regulations-the-200-foot-rule).
    Again, this seeks to minimize your impact on the area by spreading out campsites
    over time.

5.  If I’m making the effort to carry my shelter, sleep system, and food on my
    back, you better believe I don’t want to be hearing any cars at night. To try
    and minimize the chances of this happening, I want to be least 1,000 feet from
    any roads. The lower section of the trail skirts particularly close to a
    residential neighborhood, so this is an important consideration.

6.  I’m going to drop any potential campsites smaller than 0.1 km^2. Choosing
    where to actually pitch your tent within a potential site area requires many
    considerations like drainage, wind exposure, and avoiding dead trees overhead.
    This means that we want to have ample space in which to find the ideal tent
    spot, so dropping small potential sites reduces the possibility of arriving at a
    spot and finding that there’s no good place for your tent.

[^disturbance]: In very sparsely-traveled areas, it can be better to seek out campsites far from the trail to avoid camping in areas where others have recently stayed. This can help prevent the emergence of ‘social’ campsites that are not officially recognized or maintained but are frequently used. It will also reduce the chance that you’ll encounter any local wildlife that have learned that such spots can be a source of easy meals.

With all of those factors in mind, we can now define our potential campsites and
then narrow them down. I start by buffering the rivers and streams by 1,000 feet
with `sf::st_buffer()`, which gives us every area within 1,000 feet of a water
source. Then I move down my list of conditions, buffering the relevant feature
and using `sf::st_intersect()` when I want to ensure I stay *within* a given
distance of that feature and `sf::st_difference()` when I want to stay a given
distance *away* from that feature.

Since NAD83 uses meters as the unit of measurement, we need to convert these
distances in feet into meters. Again, the `units` package makes this easy with the
`units::set_units()` function.

``` r
## buffer water 750 ft
campsites <- st_union(ut_water) %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(750, ft))

## buffer water 200 ft and subtract
campsites <- st_union(ut_water) %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(200, ft)) %>% 
  st_difference(x = campsites)

## buffer trail 1/4 mile and intersect
campsites <- st_union(ut) %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(.25, mi)) %>% 
  st_intersection(x = campsites)

## buffer trail 200 ft and subtract
campsites <- st_union(ut) %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(200, ft)) %>% 
  st_difference(x = campsites)

## buffer roads to 1000 ft and subtract
campsites <- st_union(ut_roads) %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = units::set_units(1000, ft)) %>% 
  st_difference(x = campsites)

## cast multipolygon to polygons and convert to sf
campsites <- campsites %>% 
  st_cast('POLYGON') %>% 
  st_sf() %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>% # create ID variable
  filter(st_area(.) > units::set_units(.1, km^2)) # filter to > .1 sq km
```

# Elevation

So far we haven’t really done anything that you couldn’t do on CalTopo, albeit
in a less programmatic way. Let’s change that by bringing in some elevation
data. Elevation is important when hiking because it determines how many climbs
your lungs will have to endure and how many descents your knees will. CalTopo
has great built-in tools for generating
[elevation profiles](https://training.caltopo.com/all_users/tools/measure#profile)
and more detailed
[terrain statistics](https://training.caltopo.com/all_users/tools/measure#terrainstats)
that can tell you what to expect along a given route. However, you can only
calculate them for lines or polygons you’ve manually drawn.

While we could import the potential campsite polygons we’ve just generated into
CalTopo and then calculate the terrain statistics, this has two major drawbacks.
First, you have to point and click through generating the report for each polygon
because there’s no way to batch process. Second, and more importantly, this
would use a lot of processing power and computing time on CalTopo’s servers. If,
unlike me, you have a paid subscription, you might feel less bad about this, but
I’m trying not to take advantage of such an awesome service that CalTopo
currently provides for free.

We can use R’s capabilities to handle
[raster data](https://www.gislounge.com/geodatabases-explored-vector-and-raster-data/)
to solve both of these problems\! The `elevatr` package lets you easily download
elevation data in the form of a
[digital elevation model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model).
These models combine multiple measurements from satellites to produce a single
image of the earth where the brightness of each pixel represents the elevation
of a given area. `elevatr` allows you to easily access elevation data compiled
from a number of different data sources. The main function is
`elevatr::get_elev_raster()`, which takes an `sf` object as its first argument
and `z`, z zoom level of 1:14. We can also specify the `clip = 'bbox'` argument
to crop the resulting raster to just the bounding box of our potential
campsites, and not the entire tile they fall in.

``` r
library(raster)
library(elevatr)

## get elevation raster and clip to bbox
elev <- get_elev_raster(campsites, z = 13, clip = 'bbox')

## plot to inspect
plot(elev, col = grey(1:100/100))
plot(ut$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/elevation-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Since we can see that the highest point in the area is only about 300 feet above
sea level, we don’t need to worry about absolute elevation when picking
potential sites. Instead, we want to know how *level* these areas are; no one
wants to wake up smushed against the downhill wall of their tent. We can use the
`raster::terrain()` function to calculate the *slope* in each pixel.

``` r
## calculate slope
camp_slope <- terrain(elev, opt = 'slope', unit = 'degrees')

## plot slope
plot(camp_slope)
plot(ut$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/slope-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

All that’s left to do is aggregate slope measures to each polygon, and then
calculate some sort of summary statistic to tell us how steep each potential
site is overall. I’m going to use the median of each area’s slope rather than
its average to avoid giving undue influence to outliers (if a .5 km<sup>2</sup>
area is largely flat with a cliff at one edge, then it’s likely still a good
candidate for a campsite). Let’s filter out all areas with a median slope of
more than 10°.

``` r
## calculate median slope for each polygon and filter
campsites <- campsites %>% 
  mutate(med_slope = (raster::extract(camp_slope, ., fun = median, na.rm = T))) %>%
  filter(med_slope < 10) 
```

With that done, we can now plot our potential campsite locations and all the
features used to define them:

``` r
## plot campsites and all features
plot(ut$geometry, type = 'n')
plot(campsites$geometry, add = T, col = 'lightgreen', border = NA)
plot(ut_water$geometry, add = T, col = 'lightblue')
plot(ut_roads$geometry, add = T, col = 'black')
plot(ut$geometry, add = T, col = 'coral4')
```

<img src="/images/posts/gps-gis-osm/plot_final-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is a pretty picture, but it’s not very useful. To make it so that we can
actually navigate to any of these spots, we need to get them onto a topographic
map.

# Plan it

To make our map usable, all we have to do is export the potential campsite
polygons from R so that we can import them into CalTopo. CalTopo supports a
number of file formats for importing, but the one we want to use is
[GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON). We can use the `geojsonio`
package to easily convert our polygons from `sf` objects to GeoJSON format and
then save them to disk to import into CalTopo.[^export]

[^export]: Want to find potential campsites for a trail that’s not in OpenStreetMap? CalTopo supports exports as well as imports, so you can trace the route in CalTopo, export it, then load it in R with `sf::st_read()` and then carry out the steps above\!

There are two (potentially) tricky things we need to do. First, make sure we
reproject our NAD83 data back to decimal degree-based WGS84 so that CalTopo can
properly reference them. Second, we want to take advantage of R’s capabilities
to efficiently wrangle data and create a name field for our polygons so they’ll
be easy to identify and reference once they’re in CalTopo. To do this, we need
to create a “title” field in our `sf` object before we convert it to
GeoJSON.[^json-field]

[^json-field]: CalTopo refers to an object’s name field as its “Label” in the interface, but this isn’t what it’s called under the hood. I had to export a line I create and inspect the resulting `.json` file to find out that it’s referred to as a “title” instead.

``` r
library(geojsonio)

## create site number field; transmute b/c all fields other than label are lost on import
campsites %>% 
  transmute(title = str_c('Potential Site ', row_number())) %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(4326)) %>% # project to WGS84
  geojson_json() %>% 
  geojson_write(file = 'campsites.json')

## export Uwharrie Trail to save the trouble of tracing it
ut %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(4326)) %>% # project to WGS84
  geojson_json() %>% 
  geojson_write(file = 'trail.json')
```

At this point all that’s left to do is click the “Import” button in CalTopo and
select your newly created `.json` file. You can check out the potential
campsites live on CalTopo below:

Some closing thoughts viewing the potential sites in context on CalTopo:

  - Potential Site 2 looks promising. It’s slightly downhill from the trail, and
    has some relatively flat ground. However, the water source is an intermittent
    stream (denoted by the three dots in the blue line), so depending on time of
    year there may not actually be easy access to water here.
  - Potential Site 4 is located near both a perennial and an intermittent stream,
    so the odds of finding a usable water source are higher. Across the trail to the
    West you can see an area that meets all of our site selection criteria except
    gentle slopes due to the steep rise to the 795 foot peak nearby.
  - Potential Site 7 demonstrates the limitations of this approach because there
    are two forest roads near it on the Forest Service map that aren’t included in
    OpenStreetMap. Google Maps shows that there’s a [private RV campground here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carolina+Forest+Campground+\(Private\)/@35.3582376,-80.0380413,221m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8854876fa97c332d:0xabc57da731b6d41e!8m2!3d35.3582026!4d-80.0383957), so best to avoid it. Doubly so because it’s largely outside of Uwharrie
    National Forest’s boundaries (the green lines). This is why it’s important to
    check more than just the terrain before you go\!

Some coauthors and I recently published a
[piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/26/military-has-overthrown-malis-president-that-raises-questions-about-malis-ongoing-security-challenges/)
in the [Monkey Cage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/)
on the [recent military coup in
Mali](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/fears-of-a-military-rebellion-or-attempted-coup-rise-in-mali/2020/08/18/9868203e-e155-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html)
and the overthrow of president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. We examine what
the ouster of Keïta means for the future of MINUSMA, the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in Mali. One of my contributions that didn’t make
the final cut was this plot of casualties to date among UN peacekeepers
in the so-called [big 5 peacekeeping
missions](https://peaceoperationsreview.org/thematic-essays/the-end-of-a-peacekeeping-era/)
.

These missions are distinguished from other current UN peacekeeping
missions by high levels of violence (both overall and against UN
personnel) and expansive mandates that go beyond ‘traditional’ goals of
[stabilizing post-conflict
peace](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00301.x). The [conflict
management](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055414000446) aims of these
operations necessarily expose peacekeepers to high levels of risk. If we
want to try understand what the future of MINUSMA might look like
dealing with a new government in Mali, it’s important to place MINUSMA
in context among the remainder of the big 5 missions. To help do so, I
turned to the source for data on peacekeeping missions, the UN.

# Nonstandard formats

When we wrote the piece, the [Peacekeeping open data
portal](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/open-data-portal) page on
[fatalities](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/peacekeeper-fatalities) only
had a link to [this PDF
report](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/fatalities-june-2020) instead of
the usual CSV file (the CSV file is back, so you don’t technically have
to go through all of these steps to recreate this figure). Here’s what
the first page of that PDF looks like:

![](/images/posts/pdf-data/pdf.png) Since we were working on a short
deadline, I needed to get these data out of that PDF. The most direct
option is to just copy and paste the data into an Excel sheet. However,
these data run to 148 pages, so all that copying and pasting would be
tiring and risks introducing errors when your attention eventually slips
and you forget to include page 127.

## Getting the data

Enter the `tabulizer` R package. This package is just a (much)
friendlier wrapper to the [Tabula Java
library](https://tabula.technology/), which is designed to extract
tables from PDF documents. To do so, just plug in the file name of the
local PDF you want or URL for a remote one:

``` r
library(tabulizer)

## data PDF URL
dat <- 'https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/fatalities_june_2020.pdf'

## get tables from PDF
pko_fatalities <- extract_tables(dat, method = 'stream')
```

The `extract_tables()` function has two different methods for extracting
data: `lattice` for more structured, spreadsheet like PDFs and `stream`
for messier files. While the PDF looks pretty structured to me, `method
= 'lattice'` returned a series of one variable per line gibberish, so I
specify `method = 'stream'` to speed up the process by not forcing
`tabulizer` to determine which algorithm to use on each page.

Note that you may end up getting several warnings, such as the ones I
received:

    ## WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
    ## WARNING: Illegal reflective access by RJavaTools to method java.util.ArrayList$Itr.hasNext()
    ## WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of RJavaTools
    ## WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
    ## WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release

Everything still worked out fine for me, but you may run into problems
in the future based on the warning about future releases.

## Cleaning the data

We end up with a list that is 148 elements long, one per page. Each
element is a matrix, reflecting the structured nature of the data.
Normally, we could just combine this list of matrices into a single
object with `do.call(rbind, pko_fatalities)`:

``` r
do.call(rbind, pko_fatalities)
```

    ## Error in (function (..., deparse.level = 1) : number of columns of matrices must match (see arg 2)

But if we do this, we get an error\! Let’s take a look and see what’s
going wrong. We can use `lapply()` in combination with `dim()` to do so:

``` r
head(lapply(pko_fatalities, dim))
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## [1] 54  9
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] 54  7
    ## 
    ## [[3]]
    ## [1] 54  7
    ## 
    ## [[4]]
    ## [1] 54  7
    ## 
    ## [[5]]
    ## [1] 54  7
    ## 
    ## [[6]]
    ## [1] 54  7

The first matrix has an extra two columns, causing our attempt to
`rbind()` them all together to fail.

``` r
head(pko_fatalities[[1]])
```

We can see that the first page has two blank columns, accounting for the
9 columns compared to the 7 columns for all other pages. Closer
inspection of the header on the first page and the columns on both the
first and second pages reveals that there actually *should* be 9 columns
in the data.

The `Incident_Date` and `Mission_Acronym` columns are combined into one,
as are the `M49_Code` and `ISOCode3` columns. We’ll fix the data in
those two columns in a bit, but first we have to get rid of the empty
columns in the first page before we can merge the data from all the
pages. We could just tell R to drop those columns manually with
`pko_fatalities[[1]][, -c(3, 7)]`, but this isn’t a very scalable
solution if we have lots of columns with this issue.

To do this programmatically, we need a way to identify empty columns. If
this was a list of data frames, we could use `colnames()` to identify
the empty columns. However, `extract_tables()` has given us a matrix
with the column names in the first row. Instead, we’ll just get the
first row of the matrix. Since we’re accessing a matrix that is the
first element in a list, we want to use `pko_fatalities[[1]][1,]` to
index `pko_fatalities`. Next, we’ll use the `grepl()` function to
identify the empty columns. We want to search for the regular expression
`^$`, which means the start of a line immediately followed by the end of
a line, i.e., an empty string. Finally, we negate it with a `!` to
return only non-empty column names:

``` r
## drop two false empty columns on first page
pko_fatalities[[1]] <- pko_fatalities[[1]][, !grepl('^$', pko_fatalities[[1]][1,])]
```

With that out of the way, we can now combine all the pages into one
giant matrix. After that, I convert the matrix into a data frame, set
the first row as the column names, and then drop the first row.

``` r
## rbind pages
pko_fatalities <- do.call(rbind, pko_fatalities)

## set first row as column names and drop
pko_fatalities <- data.frame(pko_fatalities)
colnames(pko_fatalities) <- (pko_fatalities[1, ])
pko_fatalities <- pko_fatalities[-1, ]
```

Now that we’re working with a data frame, we can finally tackle those
two sets of mashed up columns. To do this, we’ll use the `separate()`
function in the `dplyr` package, which I load via the `tidyverse`
package. Separate is magically straightforward. It takes a column name
(which I have to enclose in backticks thanks to the space), a character
vector of names for the resulting columns, and a regular expression to
split on. I use `\\s`, which matches any whitespace characters. I also
filter out any duplicate header rows that may have crept in (there’s one
on page 74, at the very least).

``` r
library(tidyverse)

## separate columns tabulizer incorrectly merged
pko_fatalities <- pko_fatalities %>% 
  filter(Casualty_ID != 'Casualty_ID') %>% # drop any repeated header(s)
  separate(`Incident_Date Mission_Acronym`, c('Incident_Date', 'Mission_Acronym'),
           sep = '\\s', convert = T, extra = 'merge')  %>% 
  separate(`M49_Code ISOCode3`, c('M49_Code', 'ISOCode3'),
           sep = '\\s', convert = T) %>% 
  mutate(Incident_Date = dmy(Incident_Date)) # convert date to date object
```

You’ll notice I also supply two other arguments here: `convert` and
`extra`. The former will automatically convert the data type of
resulting columns, which is useful because it converts Incident\_Date
into a `Date` object, and M49\_Code into an `int` object. The latter
tells `separate()` what to do if it detects more matches of the
splitting expression than you’ve supplied column names. There are 18
observations where the mission acronym is list as “UN Secretariat”. That
means that `separate()` will detect a second whitespace character in
these 18 rows. If you don’t explicitly set `extra`, you’ll get a warning
telling you what happened with those extra characters. By setting `extra
= 'merge'`, you’re telling `separate()` to effectively ignore any space
after the first one and keep everything to the right of the first space
as part of the output. Thus, our `"UN Secretariat"` observations are
preserved instead of being chopped off to just `"UN"`.

# Creating the plot

Now that we’ve got the data imported and cleaned up, we can recreate the
plot from the Monkey Cage piece. However, first we need to bring in some
outside information and calculate some simple statistics.

## Preparing the data

Before we can plot the data, we need to bring in some mission-level
information, namely what country each mission operates in. We can get
this easily from the Peacekeeping open data portal [master
dataset](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/peacekeeping-master-open-datasets).
Once I load the data into R I select just the mission acronym and
country of operation. I then edit the strings for CAR and DRC to add
newlines between words with `\n` to make them fit better into the plot.

``` r
## get active PKO data and clean up country names
read_csv('https://data.humdata.org/dataset/819dce10-ac8a-4960-8756-856a9f72d820/resource/7f738eb4-6f77-4b5c-905a-ed6d45cc5515/download/coredata_activepkomissions.csv') %>% 
  select(Mission_Acronym, Country = ACLED_Country) %>% 
  mutate(Country = case_when(Country == 'Central African Republic' ~
                               'Central\nAfrican\nRepublic',
                             Country == 'Democratic Republic of Congo' ~
                               'Democratic\nRepublic\nof the Congo',
                             TRUE ~ Country)) -> pko_data
```

We’re looking to see how dangerous peacekeeping missions are for
peacekeepers, so we want to only look at fatalities that are the result
of deliberate acts. The data contain 6 different types of incident, so
let’s check them out:

``` r
table(pko_fatalities$Type_Of_Incident)
```

    ## 
    ##         Accident          Illness    Malicious Act   Self‐Inflicted To Be Determined 
    ##             2712             2582             2096              268              244 
    ##          Unknown 
    ##               50

Malicious acts are the third highest type of incident, so it’s important
for us to subset the data to ensure we’re counting the types of attacks
we’re interested in. Since we’re looking at fatalities in the big 5
missions, we also need to subset the data to just these missions. We’re
going to use the `summarize()` function in conjunction with `group_by()`
to calculate several summary statistics for each mission. We’ll also use
the `time_length()` and `interval()` functions from the `lubridate`
package, so load that as well.

``` r
library(lubridate)

## list of PKOs to include
pkos <- c('MINUSMA', 'UNAMID', 'MINUSCA', 'MONUSCO', 'UNMISS')

## aggregate mission level data
pko_fatalities %>% 
  filter(Type_Of_Incident == 'Malicious Act',
         Mission_Acronym %in% pkos) %>% 
  group_by(Mission_Acronym) %>% 
  summarize(casualties = n(),
            casualties_mil = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Military'),
            casualties_pol = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Police'),
            casualties_obs = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Military Observer'),
            casualties_civ = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'International Civilian'),
            casualties_oth = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Other'),
            casualties_loc = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Local'),
            duration = time_length(interval(min(Incident_Date),
                                            max(Incident_Date)),
                                   unit = 'year')) %>% 
  mutate(MINUSMA = case_when(Mission_Acronym == 'MINUSMA' ~ 'MINUSMA',
                             TRUE                         ~ '')) %>% 
  left_join(pko_data, by = 'Mission_Acronym') %>% 
  mutate(Country = factor(Country,
                          levels = Country[order(casualties,
                                                 decreasing = T)])) -> data_agg
```

  - `casualties = n()` counts the total number of fatalities in each
    mission because each row is one fatality
  - `casualties_mil = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Military')` counts
    how many of those casualties were UN troops
  - the other `casualties_...` lines do the same for different
    categories of UN personnel
  - the code to the right of `duration` calculates how long each mission
    has lasted by:
      - finding the first and last date of a fatality in each mission
      - creating an `interval` object from those dates
      - calculating the length of that period in years
  - create an indicator variable noting whether or not an observation
    belongs to MINUSMA

Finally, we merge on the country information contained in `pko_data` and
convert `Country` to a factor with levels that are decreasing in
fatalities. This last step is necessary to have a nice ordered plot.

## Plot it

With that taken care of, we can create the plot using `ggplot`. I’m
using the `label` argument to place mission acronyms inside the bars
with `geom_text()`, and a second call to `geom_text()` with the
`casualties` variable to place fatality numbers above the bars. The
`nudge_y` argument in each call to `geom_text()` ensures that they’re
vertically spaced out, making them readable instead of overlapping.

``` r
ggplot(data_agg, aes(x = Country, y = casualties, label = Mission_Acronym)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#5b92e5') +
  geom_text(color = 'white', nudge_y = -10) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Country, y = casualties, label = casualties),
            data = data_agg, inherit.aes = F,
            nudge_y = 10) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'UN Fatalities',
       title = 'UN fatalities in big 5 peacekeeping operations') +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="/images/posts/pdf-data/bar_plot-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Plot it (again)

We can also create some other plots to visualize how dangerous each
mission is to peacekeeping personnel. While total fatalities are an
important piece of information, the rate of fatalities can tell use more
about the intensity of the danger in a given conflict.

``` r
data_agg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = duration, y = casualties, label = MINUSMA)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, color = '#5b92e5') +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 1) +
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0) +
  labs(x = 'Mission duration (years)', y = 'Fatalities (total)',
       title = 'UN fatalities in big 5 peacekeeping operations') +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="/images/posts/pdf-data/scatter_plot-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see from this plot that not only does MINUSMA have the most
peacekeeper fatalities out of any mission, it reached that point in a
comparatively short amount of time. To really drive this point home, we
can draw on the fantastic `gganimate` package. We’re going to animate
cumulative fatality totals over time, so we need a yearly version of our
mission-level data frame from above. The code below is pretty similar
except we’re grouping by both `Mission_Acronym` and a variable called
`Year` what we’re generating with the `year()` function in `lubridate`
(it extracts the year from a `Date` object).

``` r
pko_fatalities %>% 
  filter(Type_Of_Incident == 'Malicious Act',
         Mission_Acronym %in% pkos) %>% 
  group_by(Mission_Acronym, Year = year(Incident_Date)) %>% 
  summarize(casualties = n(),
            casualties_mil = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Military'),
            casualties_pol = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Police'),
            casualties_obs = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Military Observer'),
            casualties_civ = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'International Civilian'),
            casualties_oth = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Other'),
            casualties_loc = sum(Casualty_Personnel_Type == 'Local')) %>% 
  mutate(MINUSMA = case_when(Mission_Acronym == 'MINUSMA' ~ 'MINUSMA',
                             TRUE                         ~ ''),
         Mission_Year = Year - min(Year) + 1) %>% 
  left_join(pko_data, by = 'Mission_Acronym') %>% 
  mutate(Country = factor(Country, levels = levels(data_agg$Country))) -> data_yr
```

Once we’ve done that, we need to make a couple tweaks to our data to
ensure that our plot animates correctly. I use the new `across()`
function (which is likely going to eventually replace `mutate_at`,
`mutate_if`, and similar functions) to select all columns that start
with “casualties”. Then, I supply the `cumsum()` function to the `.fns`
argument, and use the `.names` argument to append "\_cml" to the end of
each resulting variable’s name. This argument uses [glue
syntax](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue), which allows you to embed R
code in strings by enclosing it in curly braces. The `complete()`
function uses the `full_seq()` function to fill in any missing years in
each mission, i.e., a year in the middle of a mission without any
fatalities due to malicious acts. Finally, the `fill()` function fills
in any rows we just added that are missing fatality data due to an
absence of fatalities that year.

Now we’re ready to animate our plot\! We construct the `ggplot` object
like before, but this time we add the `transition_manual()` function to
the end of the plot specification. This function tells `gganimate` what
the ‘steps’ in our animation are. Since we’ve got individual years,
we’re using the `manual` version of `transition_` instead of the many
fancier versions included in the package.

If you check out the documentation for `transition_manual()`, you’ll
notice that there are a handful of special label variables you can use
when constructing your plot. These will update as the plot cycles
through its frames, allowing you to convey information about the flow of
time. I’ve used the `current_frame` variable, again with glue syntax, to
make the title of the plot display the current mission year as the
frames advance.

``` r
library(gganimate)

data_yr %>% 
  arrange(Mission_Year) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with('casualties'), .fns = cumsum, .names = '{col}_cml')) %>%
  complete(Mission_Year = full_seq(Mission_Year, 1)) %>%
  fill(Year:casualties_loc_cml, .direction = 'down') %>%
  filter(Mission_Year <= 6) %>% # youngest mission is UNMISS
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = casualties_cml, label = casualties_cml)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#5b92e5') +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 10) +
  labs(x = '', y = 'UN Fatalities',
       title = 'UN fatalities in big 5 peacekeeping operations: mission year {current_frame}') +
  theme_bw() +
  transition_manual(Mission_Year)
```

While the scatter plot above illustrates that UN personnel working for
MINUSMA have suffered the most violence in the shortest time out of any
big 5 mission, this animation make it abundantly clear, especially since
MONUSCO and UNMISS both experience years without a single UN fatality
from a deliberate attack. Visualizations like these are a great way to
showcase your work, especially if you’re dealing with dynamic data.
While you still can’t easily include them in a journal article, they’re
fantastic tools for conference presentations or

**Update: 05/19/2021** John MacFarlane helpfully
[pointed out](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6259#issuecomment-841861647)
that this is all incredibly unnecessary because pandoc makes it easy to add
support for footnotes to GitHub-Flavored Markdown.
[The documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extensions) notes that you
can add extensions to output formats they don’t normally support. Since standard
markdown natively supports footnotes when used as an output format, I didn’t
even think to look into manually enabling them for GitHub-Flavored Markdown.

If you’re running pandoc from the command line all you need to do is add
`-t gfm+footnotes` to your pandoc command. If you’re working with `.Rmd` files
like me, all you need to do is add `+footnotes` to the end of of the
`variant: gfm` line in your YAML header. As a side benefit, you can drop the
`--wrap=preserve` flag and end up with `.md` files that aren’t hundreds of
columns wide. I’m leaving the original post up below in case anyone who has an
even weirder use case than me might find it helpful, or if any of my students
ever stumble across this page and don’t believe that I’m still constantly
learning, too.

I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create my website. Jekyll converts
Markdown files into the HTML that your browser renders into the pages you see.
As [others](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/two-helpful-rmarkdown-jekyll-tips/)
and [I](/posts/2020/09/jekyll-html) have written before, it’s pretty easy to use
[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to generate pages with R code and
output all together. One thing has consistently eluded me, however: footnotes.

Every time I try to include footnotes in my `.Rmd` file, they end up mangled and
not actually footnotes in the final HTML page. My solution thus far has been to
just avoid footnotes and lean heavily on parenthetical asides when I’m using R
Markdown to generate a page. My recent [post](/posts/2020/09/spatial-sql) on
using SQL style filtering to preprocess large spatial datasets before loading
them into memory needed a whopping six footnotes, so I finally had to sit down
and figure it out.

# What’s happening

The ‘standard’ method for adding footnotes in R Markdown is actually a bit of a
cheat compared to the method in the official Markdown specification. R Markdown
lets you use a LaTeX-esque [syntax](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html)
for defining footnotes:

``` md
Here is some body text.^[This footnote will appear at the bottom of the page.]
```

However, Jekyll uses the official Markdown specification for footnotes, so this
won’t work. Instead, we need to define them with the official
[syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes):

``` md
Here is some body text.[^1]

[^1]: This footnote will appear at the bottom of the page.
```

However, when R Markdown converts your file from standard Markdown to GitHub-Flavored Markdown, something strange happens and the output in your `.md` file
will look like this:

``` md
Here is some body text.\[1\]

1. This footnote will appear at the bottom of the page.
```

When Jekyll converts the Markdown file to HTML, you end up with a sad lonely
unclickable \[1\] where your footnote should go. The content of the footnote
*does* appear at the bottom of the page, but it lacks the footnote formatting so
it just looks like regular text and there’s no link to click and return to the
footnote’s place in the text.

# Why it’s happening

Understanding what’s happening here (and thus how to fix it) requires a slightly
detailed explanation of what exactly happens when you hit that <kbd>Knit</kbd>
button in RStudio. First, the [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) package runs all
of the code in your `.Rmd` file and creates a `.md` file. Next,
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) takes the `.md` file and converts it to whatever
output format you want.[^1]

[^1]: Pandoc is incredibly powerful, but it’s also incredibly opaque and difficult to learn. You can create incredibly fancy PDF and HTML documents in R Markdown without ever having to know anything about Pandoc.

</figure>

Pandoc is the source of our problems here. The square braces that set off a
footnote are [metacharacters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacharacter) in
Markdown, since they’re used to construct links (among other things, like
citations with [pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc)).
When Pandoc sees them in the process of converting from standard Markdown to
GitHub-Flavored Markdown, it (logically) decides that they’re important content
and preserves them by [escaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character)
them with a backslash so they’re preserved in the GitHub-Flavored Markdown.
Unfortunately for us, we *want* our square brackets to be treated as special
characters and not turned into text. This is a known issue with Pandoc (see this
[issue](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6259) on GitHub) so it will
*eventually* get fixed, but in the meantime I’ve come up with a workaround.

# How to fix it

Pandoc allows you to tag both code chunks and inline code with a special
[raw attribute](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#generic-raw-attribute) which will
ensure they’re passed on to the output format unmodified. To do this, just
enclose any text with backticks (`` ` ``) and then put `{=markdown}` immediately
after the closing backtick. This will ensure that Pandoc doesn’t alter the
‘code’ in the backticks at all. It’s debatable whether the `[^1]` used to
define a footnote is *really* code, but for our purposes treating it like code
will ensure that our footnotes work in the final output:

``` md
Here is some body text.`[^1]`{=markdown}

`[^1]:`{=markdown} This footnote will appear at the bottom of the page.
```

There’s one more tweak we have to make to get this to work. If any of your
footnotes are longer than 72 characters,[^2] then Pandoc will split
them up and divide them into multiple lines in the output `.md` file. Since
footnotes need to be all on the same line, this will break them and you’ll have
a bunch of sentence fragments at the end of your page right above the equally
fragmented footnotes. To fix this, we need to use the `--wrap` argument to
Pandoc in our YAML header. Below is the YAML header for the `.Rmd`
[file](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/jayrobwilliams.github.io/blob/master/_source/2020-10-26-jekyll-footnotes.Rmd)
that
generates the `.md`
[file](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/jayrobwilliams.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2020-10-26-jekyll-footnotes.md)
that Jekyll uses to generate the HTML your browser
uses to render this page.

[^2]: The default output width defined by the `--columns` argument to Pandoc.

``` yaml
---
title: Footnotes in `.Rmd` files
output:
  md_document:
    variant: gfm
    preserve_yaml: TRUE
    pandoc_args: 
      - "--wrap=preserve"
knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
  rmarkdown::render(inputFile, encoding = encoding, output_dir = "../_posts") })

permalink: /posts/2020/10/jeykll-footnotes
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---
```

By specifying `--wrap=preserve`, we tell Pandoc to respect the line breaks
present in the `.Rmd` file when generating the `.md` file.[^3]
Accordingly, our footnotes will be intact and functional in the final web page.

[^3]: You can also use `--wrap=none`, which will put every paragraph in a single gigantic line of text.

# Proof

And now, to prove to you that this post really did start out as a `.Rmd` file,
here’s some R code and a plot. Everyone’s seen `mtcars` a million times, and it
turns out that `iris` was originally
[published in the Annals of Eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set),
so I went digging for a new built in dataset.[^4] I landed on the
[Loblolly pines dataset](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/Loblolly.html),
which records the height of 14 different
[loblolly pine trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_taeda).[^5]

[^4]: If you’re willing to install additional packages, Allison Horst’s [palmerpenguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) package is fantastic and fills much the same educational niche as `iris`. See [here](https://www.meganstodel.com/posts/no-to-iris/) for even more alternatives.

[^5]: Fun fact, loblolly pine seeds were carried aboard Apollo 14 and subsequently planted [throughout the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_tree).

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Loblolly, aes(x = age, y = height, group = Seed)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  labs(x = 'Age (years)', y = 'Height (feet)') +
  theme_bw()
```

It looks like all of the trees in the sample followed a pretty similar growth
trajectory! Finally, to really *really* prove this page started out as a `.Rmd`
file, here’s the `sessionInfo()`:

``` r

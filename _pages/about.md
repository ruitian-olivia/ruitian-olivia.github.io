Hello, everyone! My name is Ruitian Gao. I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Zhangsheng Yu. I received B.S. in Bioinformatics and a double B.Eng. in Computer Science and Application from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was supported by the Zhiyuan Honors Program for graduate students of SJTU. I have great passion for cross-disciplinary research of AI + Biomedicine. Recently, my research focuses on the field of Geometric Deep Learning for Biomedical Analysis.
